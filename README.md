## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While working through this project I was practiced with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I repeated font importing, css variables creating, and learned some other css properties and selections which didn't know before. Also I first time worked with media queries. 

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Overpass:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```
```css
:root {
    --orange: hsl(25, 97%, 53%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-grey: hsl(217, 12%, 63%);
}
```
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 376px) {
    .container {
        margin: 25px;
    }
}
```

The main goal for this project for me was to learn CSS. Its properties, selections and others.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
